# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Concepts and Resources:
Matrix Representation in Python:
* Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
* Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.

In-place Operations:
* Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
* The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.

Matrix Transposition:
* Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
* Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.

Reversing Rows in a Matrix:
* Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.

Nested Loops:
* Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
* Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.
