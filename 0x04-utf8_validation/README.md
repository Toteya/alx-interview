# 0x04. UTF8 Validation

## Concepts and Resources:
Bitwise Operations in Python:
* Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).
* [Python Bitwise Operators](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/BslyYNZlXdyxW3_b0WNOcg)

UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:
Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
* [UTF-8 Wikipedia](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/oqFi6P1hNvp9aSuNv---IQ)

Data Representation:
* How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
* Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

List Manipulation in Python:
* Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
